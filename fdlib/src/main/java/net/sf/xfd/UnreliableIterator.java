/**
 * Bidirectional iterator for live sequences of unpredictable size.
 *
 * <br/>
 *
 * This class was created for sole purpose of iterating over filesystem directories
 * using Linux getdents API. As such, it's capacity to represent other types
 * of sequences should be taken with a grain of salt.
 *
 * The design is largely inspired by {@link Cursor}, but this class does not pretend to know
 * sequence size in advance. Failed forward advancement keeps the last reached position,
 * failed backward advancement may keep the position or throw an {@link IOException}.
 *
 * <br/>
 *
 * The {@link Iterator} part of API makes a hidden assumption, that all filesystem directories
 * are non-empty, e.g. have at least '.' and/or '.' items; users of methods other than
 * {@link #hasNext} and {@link #next} are unaffected.
 *
 * <br/>
 *
 * This class keeps track of it's logical position in sequence, but does not take any measures
 * to prevent changes in underlying directory from introducing inconsistencies with it's contents.
 * A caller must subscribe to changes in the directory and use {@link #moveToPosition} to reset
 * iterator every time a change happens.
 *
 * <br/>
 *
 * Exceptions thrown by methods of this class can be caused by variety of reasons:
 * failed attempt to list directory contents backwards, OS bugs, hardware issues, severe
 * filesystem corruption and force-detaching some types of file-systems. Calling code should
 * attempt to recover from them by {@linkplain #moveToPosition resetting the iterator}, and provide
 * appropriate fallback if that fails.
 *
 * @param <E> type of element
