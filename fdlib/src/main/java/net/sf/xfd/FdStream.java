/**
 * Simple thread-safe Channel with support for interruption.
 *
 * This class was written with intent to avoid clumsiness and unnecessary overhead, associated with
 * traditional Channel design. It does not own the underlying descriptor, does not constantly re-assert
 * it's state and does not need excessive synchronization to guard it against multi-threaded access.
 * Yet it is completely thread-safe.
 *
 * Unlike the {@link InterruptibleChannel}, this class does not integrate with Java Thread interruption
 * framework (such integration is trivial to implement), and does not close the underlying descriptor
 * as means of the interruption. Instead the caller is expected to perform interruption in two steps:
 * 1) Provide the {@link Interruption} object to the Channel. 2) Send Linux signal to the thread,
 * performing the IO on Channel, by calling {@link Interruption#interrupt}.
