/**
 * A wrapper for Linux inotify API. This class takes care of parsing inotify event structures and
 * dispatching callbacks whenever an event occurs. See {@link InotifyListener} for description
 * of supported events.
 *
 * <p/>
 *
 * Thus class can be used in two modes: 1) direct reading from inotify descriptor using thread of
 * your choice and 2) monitoring inotify events from shared {@link SelectorThread}. To implement
 * the first mode simply call {@link #run} in a loop (depending on properties of inotify descriptor,
 * that may block until new events are ready or return immediately if no new events exist).
 * To use this class in second mode start a {@link SelectorThread} and pass it to {@link #setSelector}.
 *
 * <p/>
 *
 * Each instance of this class corresponds to a single file descriptor, returned from
 * {@link OS#inotify_init}, which can be used to monitor multiple filesystem objects. There
 * are limits to maximum number of inotify file descriptors (independent from limit on total count
 * of file descriptors) and total number of filesystem objects, monitored by application process
 * at given time. "Filesystem objects" aren't the same thing as "file descriptors" or "file paths":
 * multiple file paths, referring to the same file (e.g. hardlinks) correspond to the same
 * filesystem object (inode). <strong>The inode is not deleted until all hard links to it are deleted
 * and all open descriptors are closed.</strong> In practice this means, that maintaining a smooth
 * user experience when using inotify may require a number of precautions. Files should be monitored
 * both for deletion and changes of reference count (which happens when a file is "deleted" while
 * other hard links to it exist). More importantly, both files and directories should not be kept
 * perpetually open or else their reference count will never drop below 1.
 *
 * <p/>
 *
 * Only {@link #run} and {@link #close} are thread-safe: {@link #subscribe} and {@link #setSelector}
 * must be called from the same Looper thread as one used to dispatch {@link InotifyListener}.
